# Force-Directed Network Graph Visualization

This project utilizes D3.js to create an interactive force-directed graph that visualizes a network of publications. The visualization allows for dynamic interactions such as zooming, panning, and dragging nodes.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that hosts the visualization using D3.js.
- `publication_network (1).json`: Contains the data for the nodes and links used in the network visualization.
- `network.gml`: Graph Modeling Language file, potentially used for defining the graph structure.
- `python.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing Python code that may be used for data processing or analysis.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph**: Users can interact with the visualization by dragging nodes, and zooming and panning across the graph.
- **Data Integration**: The visualization integrates data dynamically from the `publication_network (1).json` file.
- **Customization**: CSS and JavaScript in `index.html` allow for easy customization of node and link styles.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
